{Forum-java} is a log dataset that we collected in an open source java-based web forum system \footnote{https://github.com/Qbian61/forum-java.}. This dataset contains tens of millions of log data collected by the web servers, and every log records a series of dynamic system behaviors generated during the operation of the forum system. We process the logs by creating 172,443 dynamic session networks based on trace IDs \cite{pakdd}. Each node in the network represents a log event and contains features about call status, duration, and exceptions. Each edge denotes that the event occurs after the previous event. To generate negative samples, we introduce four types of faults based on a real industry case into the system \cite{fault}. By running four versions of the system with these faults, we generate the networks labeled as ``anomalous".
