## Forum-java
Forum-java(https://github.com/Qbian61/forum-java) is an open source java-based forum platform that is widely used for social media and programming technology sharing. We can obtain the four error versions of the system by injecting each of the four fault types in a real industry case into the system. Tens of millions of logs were collected by running five different versions of the system (including four faulty versions), and then parsed into a network of 175,478 dynamic request-call networks according to trace IDs. The networks labeled "anomalous" are generated by running the four faulty versions of the system. Each edge in the network represents the calls that occur between system class files. Each node contains call status, duration, event information and exception information.
